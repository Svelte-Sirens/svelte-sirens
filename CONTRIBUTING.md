The [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/) website has a collection of resources for individuals, communities, and companies. These resources help people who want to learn how to run and contribute to open source projects. Contributors and people new to open source alike will find the following guides especially useful:

- [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
- [Building Welcoming Communities](https://opensource.guide/building-community/)

## Running Locally

You'll need **Node 24** and **pnpm 10**, and to clone the repository. Once you've done that it should be as straight forward as:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```
